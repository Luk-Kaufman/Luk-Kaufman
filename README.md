# About me:


**Luk-Kaufman/Luk-Kaufman** is ✨ _special_ ✨

- My Name is Luke Kaufman
- My Major is Computer Engineering and I am going to work my way up for a masters degree.
- One of the projects I am currently working on is a dice app, for a game called Vampire The Masquarade that calculates whether or not an action succeeds.
- Another Project I am going to start working on is creating a mod for either Crusader Kings 3 or Europa Universalis 4.
