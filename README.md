# About me:


**Luk-Kaufman/Luk-Kaufman** is ✨ _special_ ✨

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- My Name is Luke Kaufman
- My Major is Computer Engineering
- One of the projects I am currently working on is a dice app, for a game called Vampire The Masquarade that calculates whether or not an action succeeds.
- Another Project I am going to start working on is trying to create a mod for a video game.
